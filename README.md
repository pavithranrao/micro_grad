# Micro Grad

I implemented the micro grad following Andrej Karpathy's [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) 

I am planning to add few things, after understanding the inner workings:
[x] dropout
[] Convolution
    [] Stride
[] GRU
[] LSTM


Thanks to Andrej Karpathy!
